batch_size		runtime	(s)		only IO?		Throughput of IO	Comment
2048			16.772825 		No, 			61.466 MB/s			with kernel calculation
2048			15.545481		Yes. 			66.319 MB/s			only use readLSAReview to a buffer 

The percentage of parsing and IO v.s. total with calculation is
15.545481/16.772825 = 92.68%
final error rate is around 10%
